**Components Notes**
* We make different files for different components.
Note - 1. Naming convention --> jo name component ka hai wahi file ka bhi hoga

* rfce - shortcut for component snippet

* in newer versions of react, we don't need to import React from "react"; in components file 

* Hum main.jsx me bas App component ko call karte hai baaki saare components App file mei call hote hai

* Use react dev tools extension to know the structure of your react app components 

**JSX Notes**

* We use className instead of class and htmlFor instead of for(in forms) in jsx because these are reserved keywords in js.

* In a jsx file, to use a javascript we use curly braces{javascript}, for anything like template string, operations, function call etc.
