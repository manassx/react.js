# My React Learning Journey

This repository contains all my notes and small, isolated projects as I learn the React from the ground up, with the goal of mastering it.

Each folder in the `/concepts` directory is a self-contained **Vite + React** project, built to demonstrate a single core concept.

I am actively learning and pushing new code regularly.
